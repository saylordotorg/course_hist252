This course will introduce you to the major events and dynamics of three
distinct periods in African history, namely (1) the colonial period, (2)
the era of decolonization, and (3) the post-colonial period.  We will
survey African history from the “Scramble for Africa” in the late
nineteenth century and the establishment of colonial rule to the
challenges of independence spanning roughly the last five decades,
learning about the major political, economic, and social changes that
took place in Africa during these periods. In exploring the dominant
trends and patterns in African history during these time periods, we
will focus primarily on sub-Saharan Africa.  While the northern African
states of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt share many of the
same experiences with sub-Saharan Africa, the histories between northern
Africa and sub-Saharan Africa (as exemplified by the strong Arab
influence in northern Africa and the natural dividing line of the Sahara
desert) are significantly different to warrant this separation. 
Nonetheless, an occasional reference to events in northern Africa will
assist our exploration of sub-Saharan Africa. The course will be
chronologically and thematically structured.  Each unit will include
representative primary-source documents that illustrate important
overarching political, economic, and social themes in modern African
history, such as the effects of World War I and World War II, the rise
of African nationalism, decolonization and wars for independence, the
influence of the Cold War, the problems of development, and the causes
and consequences of the civil wars that have plagued African countries
in the latter twentieth century.  By the end of the course, you will
understand the historical origins of the challenges faced today by
independent African states.

### Course Information

Welcome to HIST252.  Below, please find general information on this
course and its requirements.

**Course Designers:** Christa Dierksheide, Jonathon Robins, and Ulrike
Gutberlet

**Primary Resources:** This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials.  Among the most frequently used sources are
Michigan State University’s “[Exploring
Africa](http://exploringafrica.matrix.msu.edu/students/curriculum/),”
Fordham University: Paul Halsall’s (ed.) [*Internet African History
Sourcebook*](http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/africa/africasbook.asp)*, *the
BBC World Service’s “[The Story of
Africa](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1624_story_of_africa/index.shtml),”
and West Chester University: Dr. Jim Jones’
[lectures](http://courses.wcupa.edu/jones/his312.htm).  These materials
are supplemented by a range of scholarly articles, book excerpts, audio
and video clips, and other readings.

**Requirements for Completion:** In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
The cumulative nature of history studies in general, and in this course
in particular, will require you to return to previous units and/or
subunits to undertake comparative analysis.  It is this progression that
yields a more thorough understanding of historical trends, patterns, and
discontinuities in sub-Saharan Africa.

In order to successfully complete this course, you will need to earn a
70% or higher on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be
tabulated as soon as you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you
may take it again.

**Time Commitment:** This course should take you
approximately **128.5 hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time
advisory” that lists the amount of time you are expected to spend
on each subunit.  These should help you plan your time accordingly.  It
may be useful to take a look at these time advisories and to determine
how much time you have over the next few weeks to complete each unit,
and then to set goals for yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you
6 hours.  Perhaps you can sit down with your calendar and decide to work
through subunits 1.1, 1.2, and half of subunit 1.3 (a total of 3.5
hours) on Monday night; the remaining half of subunit 1.3 and 1.4 (a
total of 2.5 hours) on Tuesday night; etc.

**Tips/Suggestions:** Before you begin this course, it is helpful to
familiarize yourself with a contemporary map of the African continent. 
The resources you will be using repeatedly reference places in Africa. A
map exercise is provided for you to test your knowledge of African
geography.  Additionally, the reference sheet of historical and
contemporary place names in Africa will be particularly useful
throughout the course (see Unit 1).
