**Unit 5: Africa and World War I & II** <span id="5"></span> 
*World War I began as a European struggle between the Triple Entente
(France, Great Britain, and the Russian Empire) and the Central Powers
(the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Kingdom of
Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire).  Many Europeans thought that the war
would be over within six months, but instead, the war escalated into a
world-wide conflict that claimed millions of lives over the course of
five years.  Because Africa was dominated by the warring European
alliances, conflict also spread to that continent.  The British and
their allies clashed with German forces in German Togoland and Kamerun,
in German Southwest Africa, and in German East Africa.  Africans were
recruited—some voluntarily, many by force—to carry supplies for military
campaigns in Africa and even to fight on European soil.  In this unit,
you will examine how seemingly isolated conflicts among European
countries both in Europe and in Africa spiraled into world war.  *  
  
 *The Treaty of Versailles, which formally ended World War I in 1919,
mandated that Germany surrender its African colonies to the Allied
powers.  While African representatives were denied access to the treaty
negotiations, France, Great Britain, Belgium, and Portugal divided
Germany’s African colonies between them.  To rebuild war-torn Europe,
colonial governments intensified their efforts to control African
populations and to extract resources from the continent.  Meanwhile, the
experience of World War I led many Africans to question colonial rule.
 Veterans of the war grew angry when they were denied the rights and
privileges of citizenship in the French and British empires they had
fought to defend.  The war also demonstrated that Europeans were not
invulnerable.  As a result, nationalist sentiments began to take root in
several countries, resulting in labor unrest, political protest, and
dissatisfaction with African “puppet” rulers. Hence, this unit will
demonstrate how the Treaty of Versailles perpetuated European
imperialism in Africa while it simultaneously gave rise to increased
frustration with colonial rule and the first signs of African
nationalism.*  
  
 *The Second World War accelerated many of the processes set in motion
by the First World War.  While Africans participated in World War II in
Africa and around the world, the political impact of the war on the
continent outweighed the material effects of the war.  Colonial
governments expected a return to the status quo in the colonies after
the war, and instead found Africans forming political organizations to
express their aspirations to equality and self-governance across the
continent.  The decade between 1945 and 1955 began with ambitious
schemes for colonial economic development to aid European
reconstruction, but it ended with colonialism on the brink of collapse
in Africa.  A focal point of this unit, then, is the ways in which
Africans responded to post-war colonial policies.*

    Ferraro.  Then, please download the PDF “More Warships for Morocco”
    by clicking on “View Full Article” on *The New York Times* website
    linked here, and read this newspaper article from July 1911 to get a
    sense of how the Agadir crisis threatened a full-blown war.  
        
     The Agadir Crisis began when Germany dispatched the warship
    *Panther* to the Moroccan port of Agadir.  Although Morocco was an
    independent state, France believed its “sphere of influence” was
    being threatened by Germany.  Colonial possessions in Africa became
    bargaining chips as Germany and France tried to negotiate a
    settlement.  If the Fashoda Incident threatened to drive France and
    Great Britain apart, the Agadir Crisis pushed them together to
    oppose German territorial ambitions.  German propaganda blamed
    Britain for “robbing” Germany of its rightful territories overseas.

     Instructions: Examine Berker’s detailed map of troop movements and

    anonymous African artist’s depiction of the surrender of the German
    commander in East Africa in “Lettow’s Surrender.”  Note that the

    officers.  
        
     The war in West Africa was short, as German forces in Togoland and
    Cameroon were quickly overrun.  German forces in Southwest Africa
    (Namibia) surrendered in mid-1915, but in German East Africa
    (Tanzania), the war dragged on until the war in Europe ended in
    November 1918.  The first image linked here has been deposited by

     Instructions: Read Bilow’s short article about the *Tirailleurs
    Senegalais*, the West African Riflemen who fought for France in both
    World Wars.  Then, read the sections titled “The Negro Soldiers of
    France and England” (pp. 117-123) of Scott’s book to see how white
    French and British officials viewed the service of African
    soldiers.  
        
     Emmott Scott’s book describes the performance of African-American
    soldiers during World War I, but this chapter emphasizes the
    contributions of black soldiers from the French and British empires.
     In contrast to American and British military facilities, which were
    highly segregated, French officials could boast that “white and
    black wounded soldiers are cared for in the same hospital by the
    same personnel.”  As the French saw it, the response of Africans to
    military recruiting efforts proved the “prodigious faculty of
    assimilation” the French colonial system allegedly possessed.

     This article of the Treaty of Versailles cedes all of Germany’s
    territories—including those in Africa—to France, Britain, and their
    allies.  The text suggests that because the colonies “are inhabited
    by peoples not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous
    conditions of the modern world,” Britain, France, Belgium, and
    Portugal should be appointed as their protectors and rulers.

     W.E.B. Du Bois, an American activist and intellectual, and other
    attendees of the Pan-African Congress did not seek an immediate end
    to colonialism; rather, they asked that European countries develop
    the natural resources of Africa “in trust for the natives,” calling
    on them to guard against “the exploitation of the natives and the
    exhaustion of natural resources.”  The Congress in effect called on
    colonial powers to live up to the idea of the “civilizing mission”
    that was used to legitimate the colonization of Africa.  “Du Bois:
    The Activist Life” is a presentation of documents concerning the
    life of W.E.B. Du Bois, hosted by the Special Collections and

     Instructions: Please click on the link above to access the text,

    through the section entitled “Significance of the Pan-African
    Movement.”  Major figures of the African diaspora that were
    instrumental for the development of the Pan-African ideal are
    explored.  It becomes apparent that Pan-Africanism, developed
    outside of Africa in response to colonialism and racial
    discrimination, played a key role in crystallizing African thought
    and anti-colonial activism, ultimately leading to independence.

     This clip is drawn from a US propaganda film made in 1942, [*The
    World at War*.](http://www.archive.org/details/WorldatW1942)(Adobe
    Flash) This segment accurately portrays Emperor Haile Selassie’s
    failed efforts to save his nation through diplomacy, although the
    film negatively portrays Ethiopians as weak and simple tribesmen, to

     In this lecture, Frederick Cooper talks about how the nature of
    citizenship in the French Empire changed between 1945 and its
    collapse in West Africa in the early 1960s.  Cooper explains that
    African “subjects” became “citizens” and that they used the idea of
    citizenship in unexpected ways.  African leaders in French West
    Africa turned to nationalism only because France failed to deliver
    the political, social, and economic equality that came with
    citizenship. This lecture, available on iTunes U, is part of the

    University Humanities Center.
