**Unit 8: Africa in the Late Twentieth Century** <span id="8"></span> 
*Leaders of African independence movements hoped to build strong states
and bring growth and development to their new states in the second half
of the twentieth century.  But in the 1980s and 1990s, many Africans saw
their standards of living decline dramatically.  The causes of this
reversal of fortune varied from country to country.  In some states,
growing debts and failed attempts at reform weakened the ability of
Africans to earn income.  In other states, political instability
hampered growth; patronage and corruption allowed privileged elites to
siphon off wealth and encouraged political rivals to battle for control
over the state and its valuable natural resources.  Finally, social and
environmental problems took a severe toll: the HIV/AIDS epidemic killed
millions of Africans in the 1980s and 1990s, while drought,
deforestation, and desertification limited the ability of Africans to
produce sufficient food.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will explore the numerous challenges that independent
African states faced at the end of the last century and explore the
uncertain future of growth and development in Africa in the twenty-first
century.*

     Instructions: Read this article to understand how African nations
    became indebted to foreign lenders and the effect that loan
    repayments had on African societies.  
        
     The “debt crisis” began in 1982 when the government of Mexico
    announced that it could no longer pay its debts to foreign lenders.
     Across the developing world, governments amassed large debts during
    the 1970s to pay for industrial, agricultural, and social projects.
     By the late 1970s, interest rates skyrocketed, and the combination
    of rising oil prices and low prices for the primary commodities
    produced by developing states severely limited the ability of
    governments to service their debts.  In Africa, the debt crisis
    forced governments to slash spending on education and other social
    services as well as to rely on new foreign loans and foreign aid for
    survival.  This essay was originally published in the *Proceedings
    of the 15th Anniversary Third World Conference Foundation* (Chicago:
    Third World Conference Foundation, Inc., 1991) and is hosted on

     Instructions: Watch this documentary (32 minutes) to see how the
    International Monetary Fund (IMF) tried to stimulate growth in West
    Africa.  
     The IMF is an intergovernmental organization charged with
    regulating the global economy.  Mired in growing debts, African
    states turned to the IMF in the 1980s and 1990s for assistance with
    rebuilding their economies.  The IMF facilitated new loans for many
    governments, but required African governments to enact “structural
    adjustment” policies that cut government spending, reduced taxes,
    privatized state-run enterprises, and eliminated regulatory
    controls.  This film, produced by the IMF in 1998, highlights some
    of the positive aspects of structural adjustment, such as increased
    competitiveness in markets.

     Instructions: Read this report and examine the charts to see how
    IMF policies have affected African states and societies.  
        
     This report shows some of the negative effects of IMF structural
    adjustment policies in sub-Saharan Africa.  The authors conclude
    that “the International Monetary Fund has failed in Africa, in terms
    of its own stated objectives and according to its own data.”  They
    show that debt has increased for many states, while growth rates
    remain poor.  IMF requirements to cut government spending have hit
    the health and education sectors severely in many states, weakening
    the tools needed to improve standards of living in African
    countries.

     Instructions: Read this four-page article to see how African
    governments reacted to the end of the Cold War.  
        
     This article, from 1992, highlights some of the effects the sudden
    end of the Cold War had on Africa.  Warring parties in several
    African states lost military and political support from the
    superpowers; in Mozambique, for example, a civil war that had raged
    between the pro-communist government and anti-communist rebel
    movement came to an abrupt end in 1992.  In other countries, like
    Sudan, civil wars raged on, with opposing factions unable to raise
    enough outside support to win decisive victories.  The waning
    strategic importance of Africa to the superpowers also meant less
    development aid. Countries aligned with the former communist bloc
    suffered the most as foreign doctors, engineers, and other experts
    left and lucrative trade deals ended.

     Instructions: Read the text for both units and explore the
    multimedia resources on the left sidebar to see how apartheid was
    defeated in South Africa.  
        
     These two units trace the end of apartheid in South Africa.
     Several factors contributed to the sudden collapse of white settler
    rule.  The end of the Cold War deprived the African National
    Congress (ANC) of material support from the Soviet bloc, encouraging
    its leaders to favor negotiations over violence.  The South African
    government also lost its main excuse for repressing the ANC—fear of
    a communist takeover.  ANC leader Nelson Mandela and President F.W.
    DeKlerk arranged a negotiated end to apartheid in the early 1990s,
    and although violent extremists on both sides worked to derail the
    process, fair and democratic elections were finally held in 1994.
     The end of apartheid changed regional politics in Southern Africa
    as well.  Apartheid South Africa was isolated and embattled
    internationally, but in the 1990s the nation emerged as a regional
    leader.

     Instructions: Read this scholarly article about recent patterns of
    African migration to the U.S.  
        
     Africans from across the continent began to move in unprecedented
    numbers in the last two decades of the twentieth century.  Many
    moved from one African state to another, displaced by war.  Many
    others left Africa entirely, headed to Europe, the Middle East, and
    North America in pursuit of a better life.  This article highlights
    the movement of Africans to the US, exploring the experiences of war
    refugees as well as “economic migrants,” who moved abroad to find
    better-paying employment.  While Africans may find new lives in the
    U.S., they maintain ties to Africa by traveling home, sending money
    to support families, or forming ethnic organizations to preserve
    their language and culture in new homes.

     This series of podcasts examines the civil war that ravaged Sierra
    Leone between 1991 and 2002.  While the war was frequently portrayed
    in international media as an ethnic conflict, the primary causes of
    the war were political and economic.  Corruption in government and
    widespread poverty in the countryside encouraged people—especially
    young people—to take up arms and fight in the conflict.  The war was
    closely connected to the civil war in Liberia, and both conflicts
    were fueled by illicit diamond mining.  While the war in Sierra
    Leone ended in 2002, the task of reconstruction is daunting, and
    government faces many of the same social problems that caused the
    war in the first place

    facing Africa in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.  
        
     This text emphasizes the human factors behind environmental
    degradation in Africa.  Desperate for land, farmers are clearing
    forests and contributing to the spread of deserts; in other parts of
    Africa, workers with few opportunities handle toxic materials to
    earn a meager income.  While specific environmental solutions like
    soil conservation or industry regulation are needed to protect
    Africa’s diverse environments, any long-term solution must take into
    account two key factors that underlie all of these destructive
    processes: widespread poverty and weak governance.
