**Unit 3: The Colonial Powers** <span id="3"></span> 
*The colonization of the African continent was carried out by a small
number of European countries.  The two primary colonizing powers were
France and Great Britain; the other colonizers were Portugal, Spain,
Germany, and Belgium.  These countries’ relative geopolitical
significance within Europe at the end of the nineteenth century accounts
for their momentous pursuit of territory and control in Africa at this
point in time.  Whereas the previous unit explored the rationale for
European powers’ colonization of Africa, this unit is concerned with the
individual colonizers and the ways in which they established their
colonial empires on the continent.  Specifically, this unit draws on
different source materials to illuminate the paths of conquest and
objectives of colonization.  You will learn that each European power
followed a similar yet distinct approach to establishing colonial
control in Africa.  Additionally, this unit begins to expose the
consequences of colonialism for African societies; this theme will be
continued in subsequent units. Finally, you will take an in-depth look
at Ethiopia and Liberia—the two African countries that remained
independent throughout the era of colonialism.  How and why did they
manage to escape Europe’s colonial fervor?*

     Instructions: Please read the entire excerpt.  This 1893 text,
    written by a British colonial administrator in what is now Uganda,
    describes the positive effects of free trade and Christianity on
    Africa.  Lugard asserts that “the African holds the position of a
    late-born child in the family of nations,” meaning that once
    Christianized, African people might become more like “civilized”
    European nations.

     Instructions: Read the short texts on British colonialism in Zambia
    and Zimbabwe to gain an overview of British motivation and methods
    for establishing colonial rule in southern Africa.  Note that Unit 5
    further explores the British role in southern Africa with respect to
    South Africa.  
        
     These brief overviews of British colonialism in Zambia and Zimbabwe
    demonstrate that British colonial interests in southern Africa
    extended beyond South Africa.  In both colonies, commercial
    interests appeared to be at the heart of ruthless exploitation of
    land and people.  Additionally, the role of the British South
    African Company under the leadership of Cecil Rhodes (who lent his
    name to the colonies of Northern Rhodesia [Zambia] and Southern
    Rhodesia [Zimbabwe]) is explored.  The texts are hosted by the
    Electoral Institute for the Sustainability of Democracy in Africa, a
    not-for-profit organization based in South Africa.

     Instructions: Read this short text to understand how Portugal, the
    oldest colonial power in Africa, consolidated its holdings during
    the late 19<sup>th</sup> century.  Note that this reading will cover
    the material you need to know for subunits 3.4.1 and 3.4.2.  
        
     This reading addresses Portugal’s position in pre-colonial and
    colonial Africa vis-à-vis other European colonial powers.  Compare
    and contrast this reading to previous readings, especially those on
    Zambia and Zimbabwe.  These readings offer fundamentally different
    vantage points on African history; they demonstrate that “African
    history” can be studied from a Eurocentric or Afrocentric
    perspective.  It is the integration of such multiple perspectives
    that allows for the most rigorous study of African history.

     Instructions: Read this entire article for an overview of
    Portuguese colonialism in eastern Africa.  It is demonstrated that

    passed.   Pay attention to the legal standing of colonized Africans
    in the Portuguese colonial system.  How does this differ from French
    and British ‘citizenship’ rights?

    colonial officials looked to the American South for a model of
    development.  Booker T. Washington’s Tuskegee Institute offered an
    appealing model for the Germans, one which told black people to work
    hard and avoid confrontation with racist policies and governments.

*Note: This subunit is covered by the reading assigned beneath subunit
4.4.2.  This reading explores a specific conflict that occurred in
German South-West Africa (Namibia) upon establishment of colonial rule. 
While African resistance to colonial rule occurred throughout the
continent, the outcomes of such resistance varied widely.  In this
reading, you will learn about the causes and motivations of this
conflict on the sides of German colonial officials and settlers on the
one hand and African indigenous peoples on the other hand.  Pay specific
attention to the grievances expressed by both sides.*

    can be seen commanding troops in the lower left.  At top-center, the

     Instructions: Read the sections on Sierra Leone and Liberia on the
    webpage linked here, and compare the similar histories of these
    countries.  
        
     Sierra Leone and Liberia were both founded as homes for former
    slaves.  Great Britain directly controlled Sierra Leone, and many of
    the freed slaves landed there were rescued from slave ships in the
    Atlantic Ocean.  Liberia’s settlers were predominantly
    African-Americans; Liberia was technically an independent state,
    although few countries respected its sovereignty.  In both
    countries, the immigrant communities settled on the coast frequently
    clashed with indigenous populations in the interior.
