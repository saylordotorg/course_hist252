**Unit 7: Decolonization and Independence** <span id="7"></span> 
*Between 1956 and 1975, more than forty new countries replaced the
French, British, Belgian, Portuguese, and Spanish Empires in Africa.
 Unwilling and unable to give Africans the political rights and economic
progress which African leaders demanded, European powers rapidly
abandoned their colonies.  Seventeen former French colonies gained
independence in 1960 alone.  Some of these transitions from foreign to
home rule went smoothly; some were rushed and chaotic.  Still more were
plagued by violence, and in Southern Africa, the stubborn Portuguese
regime fought independence movements until 1975.  Leaders of these new
African states struggled with daunting problems of political disunity
and economic underdevelopment as they tried to find a place on the
global stage.  A new factor—the Cold War between the US and the Soviet
Union and their respective allies—had a huge impact on the path to
independence as well as on the task of constructing new nation and
states.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will study the causes of decolonization in Africa and
the early problems faced by independent states.  Using detailed case
studies, we will compare the effects of local and global factors on the
path to independence in different parts of the continent.*

    and global factors influencing independence movements in Africa.
     This presentation contrasts different roads to independence in
    present-day Ghana, Kenya, and Algeria.  In Ghana, the transition to
    independence was peaceful and came swiftly in 1957.  Initially,
    Ghana was the exception, but the bitter and bloody struggles for
    independence in Algeria and other parts of Africa convinced Great
    Britain, France, and Belgium that fighting to preserve empire was no
    longer worthwhile.

    anti-colonial struggle.  The war was bloody and it ended with the
    total defeat of the Mau Mau, but the violence convinced the British
    that political negotiations with independence leaders like Jomo
    Kenyatta were preferable to continued bloodshed.

     Instructions: Read all four chapters, including subsections for
    each chapter, to understand the origins of Angola’s independence
    movements.  
        
     The Angolan war for independence and subsequent civil war between
    the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and the
    National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) remains
    one of the longest running conflicts in modern history.  The bitter
    war against Portuguese colonialism, alongside the parallel war for
    independence in Mozambique, brought the Portuguese government down
    in 1974, ultimately spelling the end of the Portuguese empire.  But
    the fighting did not end with independence, as the pro-Communist
    MPLA and pro-Western UNITA factions turned their guns on each other
    as the Portuguese withdrew.  The USSR and USA poured arms and money
    into the conflict as part of the Cold War.  The war took many
    unpredictable turns.  Apartheid South Africa fought with Portugal
    against the rebels and then with UNITA against the MPLA.  Cuban
    forces invaded in 1975 to save the MPLA government and remained
    until the 1980s.  Fighting crossed the border into Namibia, where
    the South West African Peoples’ Organization (SWAPO) was battling
    the apartheid South African state for independence.  The oil-rich
    enclave of Cabinda to the north of Angola was the site of a
    secessionist war within the wider civil war.  Funded by diamonds and
    oil, fighting in Angola raged until UNITA leader Dr. Jonas Savimbi
    was killed in 2002.

     Instructions: Read Reyes’s scholarly article, comparing the four
    main schools of thought concerning the problem of development.
     Then, please read Inukai’s article for a case study of how Kenya
    and Tanzania experimented with “African Socialism” to solve the
    problem of agricultural modernization.  
        
     Reyes’s article compares leading social science theories about
    economic growth (or the lack thereof).  Modernization theory reached
    the peak of its popularity as African states gained their
    independence and looked for ways to grow their economies and improve
    standards of living.  According to modernization theorists,
    urbanization, industrialization, the mechanization of agriculture,
    and the homogenization of society through mass media would lead to
    higher productivity and sustained economic growth.  Outside advisers
    urged African governments to pursue projects that mimicked the path
    of development followed in the United States and Western Europe,
    relying on foreign aid money and centralized planning to carry out
    these projects.    
      
     African countries did experience high rates of urbanization and
    industrialization after independence, but prosperity did not follow.
    Dependency theory emerged as a critique to the apparent failures of
    modernization theory to actually bring about growth.  *Sincronía* is

    Neo-Colonialism”](http://www.marxists.org/subject/africa/nkrumah/neo-colonialism/ch01.htm) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read this speech by Zambian President Kaunda in its
    entirety. Then, read this chapter to see how Nkrumah viewed Western
    financial and technical aid in post-colonial Africa.  
        
     Kaunda’s speech highlights the dilemma most African states faced
    after independence.  Africans had fought for freedom from colonial
    rule, but then needed resources to build up their new nation-states.
     Former colonial powers and other countries offered assistance, but
    many Africans saw this as an effort to re-establish colonial control
    over African societies.  The Soviet Union and the communist bloc
    also offered development aid, but this too came with strings
    attached.  Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, African leaders debated
    and occasionally fought over the question of forging ahead alone, or
    allying to one side or the other.  
        
     Kwame Nkrumah pursued a Pan-Africanist political platform after
    leading Ghana to independence in 1957.  In this second reading,
    Nkrumah uses Marxist economic ideology to argue that the independent
    states of Africa were becoming trapped by “neo-colonialism,” an
    informal kind of imperialism. Nkrumah viewed foreign development
    aid, foreign investment, foreign debt, foreign military bases, and
    Western culture as mechanisms that former colonial masters and the
    United States would use to indirectly control Ghana and other
    African states.  Nkrumah advocated a policy of “non-alignment” for
    Africa, maintaining distance from the U.S. as well as the Soviet
    bloc

    Colonialism](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4653125.stm)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: To access the scholarly article by Columbia
    University’s Dr. Mahmood Mamdani, follow the above link and click on
    the first document (Beyond settler and native as political
    identities …).  The BBC article is written by a Nigerian playwright
    who lives in London, UK.  
        
     Both authors reflect on the political legacy of colonialism on
    contemporary Africa.  Mamdani focuses on, first, political
    institutions of colonial rule that have been continued in the newly
    independent states and, second, Africa’s state boundaries.  In
    addressing these dynamics, Mamdani argues that the rule of law, as
    introduced and structured by colonial rule, is the most dire
    political ramification of colonialism.  Specifically, the rule of
    law under colonialism was based on a differentiation of people into
    separate and distinct groups (native, settler, ethnic group, race,
    etc.) which bears discrete consequences for political identity and,
    thus, the application of rights and obligations.  Politicized
    identities, then, were a foundation of colonial political
    institutions and continue to be reflected in contemporary
    institutions.  It is these artificial political identities that need
    to be challenged in order to build more sustainable political
    institutions.  
        
     Bandele reflects on the varying arguments advanced for Africa’s
    dismal political record.  Inexperienced political leadership,
    corruption, artificial boundaries and despotism are, in part, direct
    consequences of colonialism.  Because the colonial state was
    inherently authoritarian, so the argument goes, the leadership of
    newly emergent African states simply followed the examples set by
    colonial governments.  Bandele, however, sees the future of Africa
    resting in African hands.  
        
     Notwithstanding the various viewpoints on the legacy of
    colonialism, it is clear that colonial rule left its imprint on
    governance in African states after decolonization.  Perhaps, most
    critical is the authoritarian, undemocratic nature of colonialism. 
    Specifically, colonial administrations have relied on the threat of
    violence and its frequent use to keep populations under control.  To
    that end, strong police and military forces were formed; new African
    leaders could rely on these forces upon independence.  Law and
    order, then, were pursued to the detriment of meeting the basic
    necessities (health care, education, housing, etc.) of the people.
    In the absence of strong bureaucratic structures, firm revenue
    sources and experienced leadership and the presence of artificial
    boundaries and identities, inappropriate rules of law and corrupt
    power structures political instability was almost inevitable.

    allegations that the USA had planned the assassinations of a number
    of world leaders.  In Section A, the committee presents evidence
    showing that the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) believed
    Congo’s independence leader and first Prime Minister, Patrice
    Lumumba, was a pro-Soviet communist.  To prevent the creation of a
    Soviet satellite state in central Africa, the CIA worked with rival
    Congolese factions to assassinate the country’s first
    democratically-elected leader. HistoryMatters.org hosts primary

     Instructions: Listen to this lecture (length: 1 hour) about Ugandan
    dictator Idi Amin to understand why Amin came to power and what
    effect his rule had on Uganda.  
        
     Idi Amin’s seizure of power in 1971 had little to do with Cold War
    rivalry between the USA and USSR.  Local political competition
    between Amin and President Milton Obote led Amin to depose the
    President with the support of the Ugandan army.  While Amin received
    arms and political support from foreign powers, his policies had
    very personal and regional aims.  Under Amin, Uganda’s substantial
    South Asian community was expelled, and Amin then pitted other
    religious and ethnic groups against each other to destabilize
    potential rivals.  Amin’s regime killed more than 100,000 Ugandans
    before his ouster in 1979.  This lecture was delivered by Jeremy
    Martens for the Institute of Advanced Studies “Dictators” lecture
    series at the University of West Australia in 2007.
