**Unit 2: The Partition of Africa** <span id="2"></span> 
*The partition of Africa, also referred to as the scramble for Africa,
between 1880 and 1914 resulted in the annexation or occupation of
African lands by European powers.  By the  outbreak of World War I, only
two countries—Ethiopia and Liberia—on a continent comprising 11.7
million square miles remained independent of European rule.  The
immediate cause of this race for African territory was heightened by
tension between competing European empires.  To avoid war, European
countries negotiated the partition of Africa at the Berlin Conference.
 This “New Imperialism” was justified by an appeal to the “three C’s”:
 Christianity, Commerce, and Civilization.  Missionaries urged European
powers to intervene in Africa to create an environment in which
missionaries could safely spread the Christian religion and suppress
slavery.  Businessmen called on European governments to protect and
expand their economic interests on the continent.  Finally, Europeans
justified intervention in Africa through the idea of a “civilizing
mission” to improve Africa, a concept rooted in scientific racism and
social Darwinism, ideologies that viewed Africans as inferior peoples.
 Africans resisted the political and religious pressure of European
occupation, but could often do little to prevent annexation and
invasion.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will examine the status of African developments just
prior to the scramble and seek to explain the increased European
involvement in Africa.  While relationships between Africans and
Europeans have existed for several centuries, the end of the nineteenth
century saw a sharp change in the nature of these relationships.  Here,
we explore the reasons for this change, its manifestations in the form
of colonization, and the ways in which African societies responded to
colonization.*

    entire audio clip (29 minutes).  It offers a glimpse into various
    African societies in the pre-colonial era.  Please note the
    descriptions of diverse political, economic, and social structures
    and systems present in African societies.  Far from barbaric,
    uncivilized, and primitive as the European colonizers wanted people
    to believe, Africans had developed sophisticated societies with
    advanced administrative structures.

     Instructions: Read the excerpt to understand contemporary views
    about the economic causes of colonialism in Africa.  
        
     John Hobson was a prominent British economist.  In this excerpt, he
    discusses the idea that fierce competition among capitalists
    resulted in empire-building to find new customers for manufactured
    goods.  Hobson then proposes his own idea about why European
    countries sought colonies overseas, emphasizing the role of
    financial rather than manufacturing interests in encouraging
    imperialism in European countries.

     Instructions: Please read Dr. Mills’ lecture notes about the
    development of racism in Europe and its ramifications for
    imperialist policies (the section on “Anti-Semitism” is not
    required).  According to such thought, which was prevalent in Europe
    in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, Africa’s black people did not fit
    the conventional narrative of civilization.  This kind of thinking
    cut two ways: on the one hand, promoters of the “civilizing mission”
    argued that Europeans needed to bring civilization to Africa to
    “uplift” African peoples, to plant Western civilization on the
    continent.  On the other hand, Social Darwinists argued that
    Africans lacked the ability to create civilized societies, and
    therefore did not deserve the right to control their own governments
    and natural resources.

     Instructions: Read Dr. Jones’s overview of the Congress of Berlin
    (also referred to as Berlin Conference) to understand the underlying
    motivation for the convening of the conference and its outcomes. 
    Dr. Jones includes a link to the actual text of the “General Act of
    the 1885 Congress of Berlin” (click on the link under ‘Results’). 
    For the second reading, examine the map of Africa to see how
    European countries divided the African continent.  
        
     The Berlin Conference established a formal framework for
    establishing European colonies in Africa.  The signatories agreed to
    respect each other’s territorial claims, to suppress the slave
    trade, and to maintain a free trade zone along the Congo River.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please download the reading linked above and read the
    entire prose piece.  As you read through the document, make note of
    the different explanatory arguments presented.  Do you believe one
    is more plausible than the others in accounting for the question of
    why Europe colonized Africa?  Also, please keep these possible
    explanations in mind when you reflect on the material in Unit 3.

**2.4 African Responses to Colonization** <span id="2.4"></span> 
-   **Reading: Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture: Benjamin
    Talton’s “African Resistance to Colonial Rule” and St. Mary’s
    University: Dr. Wallace G. Mills’ “African Responses to European
    Intrusions”**

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read Dr. Talton’s essay on “African Resistance
    to Colonial Rule” in its entirety.  While the essay goes beyond the
    scope of this particular subunit, the greater part of the essay
    addresses the initial responses of African leaders and communities
    to the European conquest.  The essay goes on to include responses to
    colonial rule; this material will be explored in detail in a later
    unit.  Then, read Dr. Mills’ lecture notes on the topic.  As you
    read these pieces, pay particular attention to the varied responses
    of Africans to colonization.  It is readily apparent that Africans
    did not remain idle in the face of European conquest.   Rather,
    their options were carefully weighed and courses of action were
    determined based on local realities.  It should become clear that
    African responses to colonization cannot easily be categorized into
    resistance and collaboration.  Also, be sure to study the images and
    captions provided on the right of Dr. Talton’s essay.
