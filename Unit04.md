**Unit 4: Colonial Rule** <span id="4"></span> 
*Power, prestige, natural resources, overseas markets and missionary
fervor were forceful aspects of the European colonization of Africa. 
Once territory and people had been conquered, the European powers began
to establish colonial administrations that were geared towards the
maintenance of order and the economic exploitation of resources and
people.  Colonial rule took different forms in the colonies; the British
adhered to an administrative system termed ‘indirect rule’ while the
French, Germans and Portuguese practiced ‘direct rule.’ A third variant
referred to as ‘company rule’ completes the primary forms of colonial
rule.  In this unit you will learn about the key differences between
these types of colonial rule and simultaneously explore the
ramifications of colonialism.  Specifically, colonialism proved
devastating for African societies.  It had sweeping impacts on African
political, economic, and social structures as European powers simply
imposed their foreign ideas of governance and social customs without
respect for African indigenous practices and structures.  The persistent
undermining of African norms and ideals, in conjunction with the
imposition of artificial boundaries (both between peoples and
territories) was accompanied by continuous activism on the part of
Africans in resistance to colonialism.  Here, you will explore
resistance movements that were based in political and religious
principles.*  
  
 *Finally, this unit will introduce you to the arguments advanced in
favor and against colonialism; these arguments expose the divisiveness
among observers at the height of colonialism.  Today, it is commonly
accepted that colonialism was ethically wrong and detrimental to the
natural development of African societies.  Bear in mind the definition
of colonialism: colonialism is a political system in which an external
power forcefully subjugates a people and exerts complete control over a
territory and its people without the invitation of its people.  Hence,
colonialism is inherently undemocratic and exploitative in nature. 
Nonetheless, there remain considerable disagreements among scholars and
practitioners about the contemporary consequences of colonialism.  The
materials presented in unit 8 will address some of these issues.*

     Instructions: Click on the link above, and read through Dr. Mills’
    lecture notes on British colonial policies.  Pay particular
    attention to the discussion on indirect rule, including its
    evaluation and criticism.  The system of indirect rule that the
    British espoused as its preferred method for colonial governance is
    characterized by a small number of European officials who rule
    through the continued use of existing African governing
    institutions.  At the district level, administrators from Europe
    persuaded African leaders to follow their orders (if they refused,
    they were replaced with more willing individuals); African leaders
    had to perform such duties as collecting taxes and rounding up
    people for forced labor.  African authorities were allowed to rule
    as they traditionally had, yet they were placed in the broader
    colonial state.

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Click on the link above, and read Dr. Mills’ lecture
    notes on French colonial governance and policies.  Here, Dr. Mills
    explores the French system of direct rule.  Driven by the notion of
    assimilation, the French administrative structure was characterized
    by smaller regional units with a French colonial official at the
    head of each unit.  While “traditional” rulers were maintained, they
    lost their typical responsibilities.  The French made no attempts at
    trying to understand the various African nations’ norms and
    practices.  Instead, they imposed the alien French legal codes,
    thereby totally undermining African notions of marriage, divorce,
    crime, etc.  
        
     Both colonial administrative systems—direct rule and indirect
    rule—had catastrophic consequences for African societies.  Both were
    premised on the notion that Africans were divided into “tribes,”
    which maintained fixed political and legal systems.  The tribal
    unit, ergo, became the center of European administrations.  While
    “tribes” (people sharing common history, language, customs,
    religion, and physical features) existed, tribal identity was not
    very developed.  However, Europeans changed that.  Because they
    needed to rule through the tribal units, they emphasized tribal
    identities and even formed new tribes when none were present.  This
    created tribal/ethnic identities.  All of a sudden it meant
    something to belong to a specific tribe/ethnic group (for example
    political rights and land rights), therefore people started to
    identify with their ethnic group or tribe.  This invention of ethnic
    identities proves to be a continuing problem in post-colonial
    Africa.  Be sure to review the material in the reading for subunit
    4.1.1 for this subunit.

    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Please read this chapter on chartered companies from
    Eugene Staley’s 1935 book on the interplay between private
    investments and international politics.  Staley identifies the key
    characteristics of such companies and discusses the relationship
    between the companies and states engaged in the colonial endeavor. 
    Then, Staley describes the origins and undertakings of several
    chartered companies including the British South Africa Company, the
    Royal Niger Company, and the Imperial British East Africa Company. 
    Company rule was a distinctive form of colonial rule in the early
    years of colonialism.  While companies remained essential to the
    colonial enterprise, European governments took over the colonial
    administrations typically no later than the 1920s.  Be sure to keep

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Please read Dr. Mills’ lecture notes on the topic of
    white settlers in British colonies.  Settler rule as a type of
    colonial rule was found in those colonies in which large numbers of
    white Europeans established themselves. As such settler rule was
    limited to a relatively small number of colonies; Europeans
    primarily settled in the southern colonies of South Africa and
    Rhodesia as well as in Kenya.  Southwest Africa, Angola, and
    Mozambique also had white settlers but in fewer numbers. 
    Unsurprisingly, the interests of white settlers and Africans in the
    colonies clashed.  As you study the lecture notes, pay particular
    attention to the issues that were at the center of the disputes
    between settlers and Africans and to the ways in which settlers
    attempted to manipulate the political structures to their
    advantage.  Be sure to review the material in the reading for

    Legacy.”  Read the entries on “Movement of People,” “Dislocation of
    Families,” and “Urbanization.”  This reading provides you with a
    very brief overview of some of the social consequences of
    colonialism for African societies.  
        
     The colonial period brought about a dramatic increase in
    population; it was estimated that Africa’s population doubled
    between 1850 and 1950.  The reasons for this population explosion
    were manifold.  They included the end of the slave trade; estimates
    suggest that 11 million slaves were exported from Africa into the
    New World, but many more people lost their lives in the slave raids
    throughout Africa to procure slaves for export.  Also, there was the
    introduction of new crops.  Maize, cassava, and white Asian rice
    were introduced around 1900, and these staples brought new
    nutritional dimensions and higher yields.  The formation of
    economies allowed colonial administrations to ship food to famine
    areas.  At first, western medicine was only available to Europeans
    in Africa, but by the 1930s, most colonial regimes had begun to
    establish preventative and hygiene care centers for Africans, while
    epidemic diseases such as smallpox ceased to be major killers due to
    extensive vaccination programs.  
        
     Africa also became much more urbanized during the colonial period. 
    Between 1850 and 1950 the urban population growth averaged 3.9% in
    Africa (compared with 2.6% globally).  People left villages behind
    in search of employment opportunities or to escape patriarchal rural
    settings.  Many of Africa’s contemporary capital cities were formed
    during colonialism to facilitate the economic enterprises of the
    European colonizers.

     Instructions: Click on the link above, and scroll down the webpage
    to the section entitled “Social Practice and Legacy.”  Read the
    entries on “Religious Changes” and “Education.”  This reading
    provides you with a very brief overview of the social consequences
    of colonialism pertaining to religion and education for African
    societies.  
        
     The colonial conquest stimulated many young Africans to “embrace
    the alphabet.”  Education was seen as a way to new opportunities. 
    While missionary education (the European powers mostly charged the
    missionaries with providing basic education to the colonial
    subjects) often stressed quantity over quality, Africans tended to
    embrace the little education they could receive.  Until World War
    II, colonial governments and missions focused strictly on primary
    education.  They wanted Africans to be just educated enough to
    follow orders and to fill low-level positions in the administrative
    machinery.  Yet, colonial regimes also needed some Africans who were
    highly educated (especially in British colonies).  Hence, higher
    level institutions were founded, which produced a new generation of
    leaders.  These highly educated individuals (many also studied at
    universities in Europe and the US) began to challenge the basic
    assumptions of colonialism.  Of course, such developments were
    rather uneven throughout Africa.  The Belgian Congo, for example,
    did not allow for education beyond the primary level. The motto was
    “no elites, no problems.”  The consequence of this policy was that
    at the point of independence there were only four Congolese
    individuals with university degrees.  Under these circumstances, a
    leadership crisis was inevitable.  
        
     Christianity became a major religion in Africa during the colonial
    period. Thousands of missionaries worked in Africa and trained
    Africans to preach the word of God.  Education and literacy as well
    as Christianity’s novelty were compelling reasons to join the
    missionaries’ association.  In 1910 there were 7 million Christians
    in Africa, in 1930 16 million, in 1950 34 million, and in 1970 143
    million.  Competing missionaries spread different versions of
    Christianity (Catholic, Protestant); converts were aware of these
    discrepancies and felt that they could advance their own versions of
    Christianity.  Hence, many converts broke away from the mission
    churches and established independent churches (known as Ethiopian
    Churches).  These independent churches became focal points of
    anti-colonial protest.

    of Dr. Njoh’s paper; click on “Download Paper” under the abstract to
    see a PDF version of the full 16-page paper.  Please read the entire
    paper.  Dr. Njoh discusses the nexus between transport
    infrastructure and development.  In doing so, he traces the
    development of such infrastructure in Africa from pre-colonial
    through post-colonial times.  The current status of Africa’s
    infrastructure, however, is largely attributed to the economic
    policies of the colonial governments.  Pay attention to the types of
    infrastructure developed by European colonizers and their rationale
    for building specific routes.  Dr. Njoh continues to explore the
    role of transport infrastructure for contemporary development.  This
    is ostensibly outside the scope of this particular subunit;
    nonetheless, it is illuminating for recognizing the connections
    between colonial and current events and dynamics.

    abysmal development record in the post-independence period.  In
    doing so, his focus rests on the economic policies of the colonial
    period and the structural adjustment programs that African
    governments were compelled to adopt in later years.  The economic
    legacy of colonialism includes a discussion of such aspects as
    infrastructure investments, education policies, commerce
    regulations, and attitudes toward African enterprise.

    development.  This chapter of Dr. Rodney’s groundbreaking book
    entitled *How Europe Underdeveloped Africa,* published in 1972,
    explores the colonial system itself and argues that colonial
    structures allowed Europe to exploit Africa and ensured that
    Africa’s previous advances in the economic realm were reversed.  He
    carefully constructs an argument designed to expose the negative
    ramifications of colonialism for the African continent and its
    peoples.  His book has been very influential in the field of African

     Sudan (often rendered “Soudan”) was a colony of Egypt, which was
    itself under British control, until 1881.  Muhammad Ahmad declared
    himself the “Mahdi” (the “guided one,” an important figure in
    Islamic eschatology), and preached against European encroachment and
    political and religious corruption in the Egyptian government and
    the entire Islamic world.  Mahdist forces annihilated an
    Anglo-Egyptian army in 1883 and captured the capital of Sudan,
    Khartoum, in 1885.  Although the Mahdi died in 1885, his successors
    ruled Sudan until 1898, when a new Anglo-Egyptian army backed by
    gunboats and a railroad toppled the Mahdist government.

    1904”](http://www.ppu.org.uk/genocide/g_namibia.html) (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: First, read the entire BBC article to understand how
    taxation and other economic burdens imposed on Africans by Europeans
    provoked resistance.  Then, read the four sections titled “Before
    the Genocide,” “the Genocide,” “After the Genocide,” and “Witness”
    in the “Talking about Genocide” article.  Please note that the
    “Namibia, 1904” reading covers the topic outlined by subunit 3.6.3. 
    Also, be sure to compare and contrast the information presented with
    Dr. Talton’s essay “African Resistance to Colonial Rule” in subunit
    2.4.  
        
     The Herero and Nama peoples of present-day Namibia initially
    peacefully coexisted with German settlers.  German seizures of land
    and cattle and other abuses provoked rebellion among the Herero and
    Nama peoples.  The German military responded by forcing the
    insurgents into the desert to die of thirst, and by killing
    thousands of others in concentration camps.  “The Story of Africa”
    is a text and radio project from the BBC World Service that tells
    African history from an African perspective.  The Peace Pledge Union
    is a British organization committed to educating the public about
    war and genocide.

     Instructions: Read President Roosevelt’s short speech and Kipling’s
    famous poem on the merits of colonialism.  President Roosevelt’s
    speech discusses regions of Africa that he thinks were improved by
    colonial rule.  Roosevelt believed that European interventions in
    Africa were required to create political stability and to generate
    economic growth.  The British poet Kipling wrote “The White Man’s
    Burden” in 1899 to urge the US to pursue an imperialistic policy
    upon its recent acquisition of the Philippines.  He seems to espouse
    the notion that colonialism, while bearing a cost to the colonizer,
    is beneficial to both colonizer and colonized; indeed, the West is
    obligated to rule over non-Western peoples.  Both Roosevelt’s and
    Kipling’s writing embody the prevalent viewpoints of their time that
    allowed colonialism to proceed.

    Policy](http://marxists.org/archive/kautsky/1907/colonial/3-ethic.htm)”
    (HTML)  
        
     Instructions: Read the excerpts from E.D. Morel’s *The Black Man’s
    Burden* and Karl Kautsky’s observations on “The Ethic of the
    Colonial Policy.”  
        
     The French-born Morel, upon learning of the atrocities committed in
    King Leopold’s Congo, led a campaign against slavery and
    exploitation in the Congo Free State from his home in Great
    Britain.  His book *The Black Man’s Burden*, published in 1920,
    makes direct reference to Kipling’s poem and presents a thorough
    discourse on the fallacies of colonialism.  Karl Kautsky, a
    Czech-German socialist philosopher, contributed to the intellectual
    debate raging among German Marxists/Socialists in the early
    19<sup>th</sup> century about the virtues of colonialism.  His
    treatise *Socialism and Colonial Policy*, written in 1907, rejects
    the legitimacy and value of colonialism on ethical grounds.  Both
    Morel and Kautsky, while out of line with contemporary thought on
    the issue, must still be regarded as racialists; both believed that
    the white race was superior to other races and that contact with the
    white race was inherently beneficial to those races.  However, the
    exploitative nature of colonialism was objectionable to the
    activists/thinkers.
