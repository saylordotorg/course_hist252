**Unit 1: Background Information for History of Africa from 1880 to the
Present** <span id="1"></span> 
*This brief introductory unit is designed to introduce you to the
discipline of African history and to provide background information that
will serve as reference points throughout the course.  Specifically, the
relative ‘novelty’ of African history compels us to consider the origin
and state of African history as a legitimate field of academic inquiry. 
Understanding the (at worst) dismissal and (at best) marginalization of
African history in historiographies is critical to our reading and
interpretation of historical texts.  Not only is it essential to
recognize and pay attention to the source of the material, but an
appreciation for the perceptions of African history by historians and
practitioners alike permits us to engage the material in a more thorough
and critical manner. *  
  
 *Additionally, this unit sheds light on various aspects of Africa’s
climate and geography.  While it may seem out of place to concern
ourselves with geography in a course on African history, the linkage
between the two is undeniable.  In fact, geography informs history;
geographical realities have significant impact on socio-economic and
political developments.  Therefore, a brief introduction to important
geographic features will aid your exploration of African historical
developments in subsequent units.  Furthermore, you are encouraged to
familiarize yourself with a contemporary map of the African continent. 
A basic knowledge of the location of African countries, capital cities
and geographic features will facilitate your study of African history.*

     The political map of Africa is relatively new.  Only since the end
    of colonialism and the emergence of new countries on the African
    continent has Africa’s political map solidified into its present
    form.  In fact, this 2008 map is already outdated as Africa’s newest
    country—South Sudan—gained its independence on 9 July 2011 (this is
    reflected in the reference map below).  Please note the
    fragmentation of the continent in terms of the sheer number of
    countries as well as the peculiarities of their shapes. 
    Specifically, there are a total of 55 countries in Africa (those who
    do not recognize Western Sahara as an independent country put the
    number at 54).  Some countries are rather oddly shaped.  The Gambia
    in western Africa, for example, extends for 220 miles along the
    Gambia River and is no more than 18 miles wide; it has a small
    coastline and is otherwise surrounded by Senegal.  Lesotho, on the
    other hand, is completely surrounded by South Africa.  Also,
    noteworthy is the unusually high number of landlocked countries
    (countries that lack direct access to the sea).  Africa has 15
    landlocked countries; these countries are among the world’s least
    developed countries due to, in part, their vulnerability with
    respect to transportation.  Such peculiarities point to the
    artificiality of Africa’s borders.  These borders are recent and
    typically unrelated to cultural or political realities as they are a
    direct consequence of colonialism.

     The first map depicts Africa’s relief and drainage system.  It
    illustrates the continent’s description of plateau continent.  “High
    Africa,” the parts of the continent south of an imaginary line
    stretching from northern Angola in the west to northwest Ethiopia in
    the east, is characterized by plateaus and plains 1000 to 2000
    meters above sea level.  “Low Africa,” the parts of Africa north of
    this imaginary line, is marked by low plains usually under 500
    meters above sea level.  The color shading on the map reflects these
    differences in elevation.  In essence, the geological age of the
    African continent, in conjunction with the dynamics of plate
    tectonics, led to the creation of these plateaus, which are
    characterized by sharp, steep edges (most prominently witnessed in
    east Africa’s Great Rift Valley).  The second map shows Africa’s
    natural vegetation zones.  Note the vegetation zone of southern
    Africa as this is instrumental in explaining African-European
    interactions in this part of the continent.
