**Unit 6: White Settlement in South Africa** <span id="6"></span> 
*European colonialism in Africa took two general forms.  So far, this
class has focused on the first type, colonial rule without settlement.
 Under this kind of colonialism, European powers exploited the natural
and human resources of Africa but did so through relatively small groups
of European government, military, and business officials.  This form of
colonial rule was most common in West and East Africa, where tropical
climates and diseases made immigration an unattractive proposition.*  
  
 *Settler colonialism was a very different kind of colonial rule, in
which large groups of Europeans established permanent residence in
Africa.  The areas most amenable to European settlement were located in
Southern Africa and the East African highlands (modern day Kenya).  In
these regions, white settlers formed a powerful political bloc and
fiercely opposed African nationalist and anti-colonial movements.
 Conflict between white settlers and native Africans had a long and
violent history in southern Africa, and political violence reignited in
settler colonies as Africans struggled for self-rule after World War
II.*  
  
 *In this unit, we will focus on present-day South Africa, tracing the
history of settler rule from the first Dutch settlers in the
17<sup>th</sup> century to the emergence of the apartheid system in
independent South Africa in the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century.  We will
examine how white settlers tried to increase their control over southern
Africa while the rest of the continent raced toward independence from
European control.*

    as well as moving groups of warriors and refugees.  South African

     These podcasts will help you learn about passbooks and labor
    control in South Africa.  Passbooks were one tangible sign of
    apartheid in South Africa.  Africans, Asians, and other
    non-Caucasian ethnicities were required to carry identification to
    live, move, and work in South Africa.  Passbooks allowed the
    apartheid government to control labor, slowing down migration to the
    cities and keeping under-employed workers in the countryside to
    create cheap labor for white farmers.
